Note: Both problems and solutions are either original work or have been adapted from 
online content to improve student learning. Answers and questions have been reviewed
by Professor Potechin of the University of Chicago and were originally written and
conceived by Giovanni Longo, M.S. Financial Mathematics and B.S. Applied Mathematics.

During his time as a grader for the UChicago CS department, Giovanni created a practice 
midterm and final (with answers) for enrolled students. While these documents provide 
tangible evidence of his committment to helping others understand complex mathematical 
concetps, he has continued to be a guide for those who want to eventually pursue technical
research or otherwise develop their mathematical skillset for future endeavors.
